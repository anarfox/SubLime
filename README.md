## Description ##
So you got your Kodi entertainment center set up, probably one or more media downloaders like CouchPotato or Flexget that will also automatically get subtitles, or maybe you use Subliminal for this. Maximum enjoyment with minium effort, right? Well, not always.

Subtitles come in a lot of formats and markups, using  captions for the hearing impaired,  forced font colors,ALL CAPS and noawadays some even got advertisements in them. Not all of these are equally bad, but they can be annoying. And sometimes, there just isn't a clean sub available.

SubLime lets you choose which markup you want to keep, and which you want to filter out.
